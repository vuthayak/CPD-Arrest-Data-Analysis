# CPD Arrest Data Analysis Project
Developed by vuthayak (Student from University of Waterloo).

This project is a walkthrough of an application of data science + machine learning through python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pytorch`, `scikit-learn`). Dataset used is [Chicago PD Public Arrest Data](https://home.chicagopolice.org/statistics-data/public-arrest-data/).

## Instructions
Analysis is conducted via `CPDAnalysis.ipynb` and executes on a codeblock-by-codeblock bases. Between codeblocks are markdown segments, identifying and explaining trends found through the analysis.
